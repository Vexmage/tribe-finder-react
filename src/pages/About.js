        <p>
          <strong>Tribe Finder</strong> is a web tool designed to help users locate tribal governments 
          near a given ZIP code within the United States. Whether you're seeking contact information, 
          learning more about local tribes, or working on a project involving tribal communities, this 
          tool offers a quick starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our data is sourced from official directories and geocoded to help you find the closest 
          tribal governments by proximity. Simply enter a ZIP code to see nearby tribes, their names, 
          and approximate distances.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is a work in progress and will continue to evolve with new features, resources, 
          and improvements based on user feedback and data availability.
